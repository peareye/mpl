# Messages

You website may have a contact form for visitors to submit messages. This is a design consideration set by your website designer. If configured, when visitors submit a message you will receive an email with the message, and a copy of the message will be kept in PitonCMS for reference.

## Configure Messages

The contact form must be added to a published page as a page *Element* for visitors to access. To add a contact form:

* Go to **Pages** and edit or create a page with a template block enabled with *Contact Form*.
* Click *Add Element*, and then optionally add a *Title* and some leading text *Content*.
* Save the page, and ensure it is Published.

To receive the submitted messages, you will want to add your email address in Site Settings. Note, this can be separate from your login email address.

* Go to Tools > Contact.
* Enter your email address where you want to receive messages.
* Enter a response message after someone submits a message
* Save

## Manage Messages in PitonCMS

All submitted messages are kept in PitonCMS for reference. The number of new messages are indicated next to the **Messages** navigation link. You can mark messages as read, or as unread, and delete messages if you wish.

**To View** Go to Messages. The default view is unread.

**To Change Read Status** Click the *Read* or *Unread* button next to the message.
