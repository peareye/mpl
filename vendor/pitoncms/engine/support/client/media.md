# Media Images

PitonCMS can manage and optimize (with a Tinify key) JPG and PNG images for use in your website. For videos, we recommend hosting the video with any one of the popular video streaming services and then embed the video link in a **Page Element**.

## Tiny JPG and PNG Key

Tiny JPG is a web service to optimize and compress your JPG and PNG files for use on the web. It will also create optimized thumbnail and alternate sizes for use throughout your website. Tiny is optional to use, but without a Tiny API key only the original full sized images will be used on your website, with a slower visitor experience.

Tiny is free to use for the first 500 image operations per month, more than enough for most uses. (PitonCMS uses four image operations per image upload.)

To get your key, go to [Tiny API](https://tinyjpg.com/developers) and enter your name and email address. Once you get the Tiny login link in your email, login to Tiny and copy the key value. Then in PitonCMS go to Tools > Settings and paste in your key to **Tinify API Key** and save.

## Media Image Galleries

Before you upload your first image, consider creating some **Media Galleries**. You can add, remove, and alter gallery categories later, but it is easiest if you have one or two at the start.

1. Go to Media > Galleries.
2. Enter one or more Gallery cateogory labels, and click *Add* button for each label.

## Media Image Uploads

From the Media > All Media page you can browse existing images, modify gallery category sets, remove image, and upload new images.

1. Go to Media > All Media.
2. Click *Upload New Media*. Select an image file to upload.
3. Check any relevant gallery categories. You can assign gallery categories later as well.
4. Check the **Featured Media** box to make this image an enhanced or key image in your galleries.
5. Click *Upload*.
   * Note, there is a delay as the images are optimized by Tiny as you upload.

## Manage Media Images

From Media > All Media, you can manage your media galleries and images.

To delete an image, click the *Delete* button under the media image.

To add or remove an existing Gallery category, check or uncheck the category box under the image and press *Save*.
