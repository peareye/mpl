# Collections

Collections are groups of *related* pages such as blog posts, recipes, services etc. and consist of *Collection Detail Pages* (each accessible at a specific URL). Collections are ideal to categorize similar topics on your website.

Collection Detail Pages are not listed in the normal navigation page links, and instead are accessed through a *Collection Summary* which is a group of collection page links within a single collection, embedded in a page **Element**. As you add new pages to your collection, the links will automatically appear in the Collection Summary (if the page is published).

## Create New Collection
To create a new Collection group, select the **Content > Collections > Add Collection Group** menu.

Enter the **Collection Title** to describe the collection.

The **Collection Slug** defaults to the title (but cleaned up), but you can edit the slug if desired.

**Note**: Once a detail page has been added to the collection, you must unlock the slug by clicking the lock icon to make changes. Changing the collection slug with a published detail page may break links to your website.

Select a **Collection Template** from the list of available templates.

**Note**: Once a detail page has been added to the collection, you can no longer change the template used for the collection's detail pages.

## Edit Collection Group
To edit a collection group, go to the **Content > Collections > All [Collection] Pages**. From the page where you view the collection detail pages, click on the **Edit** link next to the collection title.

If pages have been added to the collection, you can only change the collection title.

Click **Save** in the sidebar.

## Delete Collection Group
Once a detail page has been added to the collection, you can no longer delete the collection group. You must first remove all detail pages in this collection before deleting the collection group.

To delete a collection group, go to the **Content > Collections > All [Collection] Pages**. From the page where you view the collection detail pages, click on the **Edit** link next to the collection title.

Then click **Delete** in the sidebar and acknowledge the warning prompt.

## Publish Collection Group
Collection pages are not part of the normal website navigation bar links structure. Instead, the collection page links are displayed as a group in a page **Element**.

To publish the links to the collection,

1. Create or edit the static Page that will show the collection links.
1. Add a new **Element** in the desired **Block**, and select **Collection** as the Element type.
1. Select the name of the collection to display
1. Save the page

As you add new collection detail pages, the new pages will automatically appear in your collection summary (if hte page is published).

## Create Collection Detail Page
You can create a Collection Detail Page either from:

*  The **Content > Collections > Add [Template]** menu.
*  The **Content > Collections > All [Template] Pages** where you would view the pages in the collection. Click the **Add [Template] Page** link.

Creating a collection page follows the same process as a normal page. See [Page help](/admin/help/adminPage).

## Editing Collection Detail Page
To edit a collection detail page, use the **Content > Collections > All [Template] Pages** menu to see all pages in the collection. Then find the desired page and click **Edit**.

Editing Pages and Collection Detail Pages are similar. See [Page help](/admin/help/adminPage).
