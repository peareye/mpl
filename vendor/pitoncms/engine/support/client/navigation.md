# Navigation

With the **Content > Navigation** menu, you can control which page links appear and in what order in any navigator. Your website designer will have defined the navigator groups, such as main, footer, sidebar, etc.

The navigation manager allows you to:

* Add a page to any navigator (but not collection detail pages)
* Set the desired position of the link
* Edit the link text (defaults to the page title)
* Add a dropdown menu to a list of child links
* Deactivate a link temporarily to remove it without deleting the link entry

To edit a navigator, go to **Content > Navigation > Edit [Navigator Name]**.

Here you can add, delete, rename, and deactivate or reactivate navigation links. Make your changes, and the press save.

**Note**: When clicking delete on a navigation link, the link is not immediately deleted, it is marked for deletion (and turns red). The delete happens when the navigator is saved.
