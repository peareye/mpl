# Tools

The Tools in PitonCMS help you manage your custom website.

Your web designer may have added additional customer settings not listed below.

### General
**General Settings** control general site configuration settings.

* **Date Format** Controls how dates are displayed on your website. Choose from:

### Contact
If your web site design has a contact form enabled, enter your message inbox email address and acknowledgement message.
