# Collections

Pages are content accessible at a specific URL. A page can be a static page, meaning the page at that URL is standalone from others. Examples include the Home page, About, Contact etc.

However, sometimes you may wish to create a series of pages that are grouped by a common theme, and this is where a Collection Group comes in. Collections are sets of related Pages. Examples include blog posts, recipes, services and attractions, and other groupings.

The Collection Detail Pages are also accessed at a specific URL, but the collection of pages can be dynamically grouped in some navigation menu so then a new Detail Page is added to a Collection, that new page automatically appears in the right navigation. This aids visitors who are browsing your website.

## Collection Groups
To start to create a Collection Group, there must first be a Page Template with the property `"templateType": "collection"` defined. This template is _not_ available to select for static pages, but the template _does_ appear in the Collection manager under **Settings > Collections > Add Collection**.

This Page template should be suitable for the repetitive nature of the collection pages.

Once a template has been defined for collections, then the user can go to Settings > Collections and then Add > Collection. Here the user will define a title for the new collection, provide the URL slug (segment) for the collection, and select the desired template (if there is more than one collection type).

It is possible to create more than one Collection Group for a given collection page template. An example might be a page template suitable for recipes, and the user can create a collection group for Entrees, Desserts, Side Dishes etc., all using the same template layout but logically grouped by content.

Once the Collection Group has been defined, the user can create a new detail page from the Content manager > Add collection template.
